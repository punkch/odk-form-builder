/**
 * Assemble a FormDocument (plus its attachment blobs) from a form on an ODK
 * Central server — a published form, or the current draft of a never-published
 * form — the pure counterpart of the ImportDialog "From Central" source.
 *
 * Pure core: no Vue/Pinia/Dexie/vue-i18n imports. The (already token-bound)
 * `CentralClient` is injected, so unit tests drive this with a fake client and
 * never touch the network; the store owns token lifetime and passes both the
 * client and the token in.
 *
 * THE load-bearing detail: `parseXForm` sets `document.attachments = []` and
 * never populates it (parser.ts). If we returned the parsed document as-is, its
 * attachment refs would be empty, so (a) `validate/refs.ts` would flag every
 * referenced file as "referenced but not uploaded", and (b) the zip export
 * would omit the blobs. We therefore rebuild `document.attachments` from
 * Central's attachment list (via the shared `roleFor` classifier) before
 * returning, matching the shape the archive-import landing path expects.
 *
 * Central marks an expected-but-not-yet-uploaded attachment as `exists:false`;
 * those are skipped (nothing to download). `createFormWithArchiveAttachments`
 * uses `dropUnmatched:true`, so a skipped file also drops from
 * `document.attachments` on landing — the same "missing = not uploaded"
 * behaviour as a file import.
