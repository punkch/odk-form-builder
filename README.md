</a>

*No install, no account, no server — and it keeps working offline once loaded.*

</div>

A visual builder for [ODK](https://getodk.org) forms that runs **entirely in
your browser** — no server, no account, no data leaving your device. Forms
are stored locally (IndexedDB), edited visually, previewed live in the
official [`@getodk/web-forms`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@getodk/web-forms)
engine, and exported as XForm XML, XLSForm (.xlsx), or either bundled as a
ZIP ready for ODK Central. When you opt in, it can also publish drafts to and
import forms from your own ODK Central servers. Installable as an
offline app on field laptops and tablets.

## Highlights

- **Real preview, not a mock** — the same engine ODK Central serves renders
  your form as you build it, including relevance logic, constraints,
  cascading selects, external datasets and translations. Test-fill and
  inspect the submission XML without anything leaving the browser.
- **pyxform-parity XForm generation** — the serializer's output is golden-
  tested against [pyxform](https://github.com/XLSForm/pyxform) 4.5.0
  (`tests/golden/`), entities included, so generated forms behave exactly
  like XLSForm-converted ones.
- **Native XLSForm engine** — imports and exports .xlsx workbooks fully
  client-side; the first in-browser XLSForm converter (everything else in
  the ecosystem calls pyxform on a server).
- **Lossless round-trips** — unknown columns, custom bind/body attributes
  and unrecognized XForm fragments are preserved through import → edit →
  export.
- **Form logic without syntax** — a visual condition builder for relevance
  and constraints, with the raw expression editor always one click away.
- **Multilingual forms without the footguns** — labels, hints, guidance,
  validation messages, choice labels and per-language media in one
  translations grid; a monolingual form's text simply becomes the first
  language you add — no "Default" pseudo-language that ODK clients would
  never show.
- **Label media & image annotation** — attach an image (with zoomable
  big-image), audio or video to any question or choice label, and give
  image questions a draw-on-top template; the attachment manager flags
  missing files and a rename updates every reference in one step.
- **Direct to ODK Central, opt-in** — publish drafts (definition +
  attachments) to any number of Central servers, track every destination
  with a local freshness check and one-click re-publish, and import
  forms back — even never-published drafts — without leaving the builder. It stays invisible
  until you add a server; credentials are encrypted at rest in a
  passphrase-derived vault that never leaves your device, and every
  connection is manual — no background sync, no telemetry. Requires a
  one-time [CORS setup](#connecting-to-odk-central-cors) on (or in front
  of) your Central server.
- **Works fully offline** — installable PWA that precaches the entire app
  (preview engine included) and updates itself from the hosting site.
- **Embeddable** — host applications can drive the builder in an iframe
  over a postMessage API: load a form, let the user edit, get the full
  configuration (attachments included) back.
- **Accessible, themeable, in your language** — English, French and
  Spanish UI, light/dark/system color schemes with six accents, and a
  WCAG-AAA high-contrast mode — all styling the builder and the live
  preview as one.

## Features

### Available

- ✅ **Visual editor** — ~40 question types, drag-and-drop question tree
  with keyboard commands, property panel, undo/redo, autosave, crash
  snapshots, multi-form library
- ✅ **Multi-select & clipboard** — Ctrl/Shift-click (and Ctrl+A) selection
  in the canvas with cut/copy/paste/delete acting on the whole selection,
  one undo step per action; paste works **across forms and browser tabs**
  (names de-duplicated, choice lists brought along, translations matched to
  the target's languages with anything dropped reported); the selection
  moves together by drag or Alt+Arrows, including into groups. A canvas
  toolbar hosts undo/redo, the clipboard actions, a selection counter and
  the form menu — including **"Insert from template"**, which appends a
  template's questions to the open form
- ✅ **Live engine preview** — real `@getodk/web-forms` rendering, device
  presets, submit testing with submission XML inspection; the preview
  follows the canvas selection (scroll + highlight) and stays on the
  question being edited across refreshes
- ✅ **Import** — XForm XML (lossless) and XLSForm .xlsx with row-level
  import reports; also accepts a form ZIP bundle (`form.xml`/`form.xlsx` +
  `media/` attachments, our own export layout), landing the form with its
  attachments restored and a Copy/Replace prompt on a form-id collision
- ✅ **Export** — XForm XML, XLSForm .xlsx, or either as a ZIP bundled with
  media/CSV attachments for ODK Central; the export button states its format
  and remembers the last format you chose, per form
- ✅ **ODK Central integration** — opt-in publish and import through a
  non-modal **Central panel** (a slide-over beside the form, never a stack of
  pop-ups), off until you register a server:
  - **Central hub, per form** — one panel lists **every** destination the form
    has been published to (server · project · form id, last version + time),
    each with a **freshness** chip (Up to date / Changed, a purely local content
    compare) and a one-click **Re-publish** / **Publish update** whose progress
    and result render inline on the row. **Publish to a new destination** expands
    inline without leaving the panel.
  - **Publish draft** — push the open form's draft (definition + attachments)
    to a Central project, surfacing Central's validation warnings verbatim; on a
    form-id/version collision, offer to update the existing form or bump the
    version and retry. Promoting the draft to a live version stays in Central's
    own UI, by design.
  - **Check server** — a per-destination metadata read (Central's version, no
    XML download) reconciles what you last sent against what Central now holds.
  - **Import from Central** — a matching Central panel on the Form Library:
    pick server → project → form (a never-published form is listed with an
    "unpublished" tag and imports its current draft), pull the XForm and its
    attachments, and land it with the same row-level report as file import
    (replace-or-copy on a name collision), seeding the origin as the form's
    first destination (published imports only — a draft has no publish
    history to record).
  - **Multi-server, tracked destinations** — register several servers; publish
    the same form to dev/staging/prod and re-deploy to any of them in one click.
  - **One-per-session vault** — passwords stored encrypted at rest
    (non-extractable AES-GCM, key derived from one passphrase you enter once per
    session, unlocked inline in the panel — no modal); the key and session
    tokens live in memory only. Server config + publish history ride along in a
    **whole-workspace backup**; saved passwords do so only if you opt in on
    export (a warning is shown). A **single-form share** never carries any
    Central data.
  - See the [CORS requirement](#connecting-to-odk-central-cors) below —
    reaching a Central server from the browser needs a one-time server-side
    (or local-proxy) setup.
- ✅ **Choices & cascades** — shared choice lists, cascading-select editor,
  choice filters
- ✅ **Form translations** — multi-language labels, hints, guidance hints,
  constraint/required messages, choice labels and media filenames; the
  grid shows every relevant site even before it has a value (hint rows
  and rarely-used fields stay behind toggles until they hold text), and
  the properties panel edits one explicit
  language at a time — fallback text appears as placeholder, never as
  editable text. No "Default" pseudo-language: a monolingual form's text
  converts into the first language you add (which becomes the form's
  default language), matching what ODK clients actually show; mixed
  imports auto-merge, with leftovers kept visible in an Unassigned
  column until resolved
- ✅ **Visual logic builder** — field/operator/value rows with ALL/ANY
  groups for relevance and constraints, constraint presets (ranges, phone,
  email…), calculation templates; unrepresentable expressions stay safely
  in the raw editor
- ✅ **Validation** — live problems panel with click-to-navigate; expression,
  reference, structure, translation, dataset and entity validators
- ✅ **External datasets** — upload CSV/GeoJSON straight from the question's
  property panel (feeds itemsets and `pulldata()` in the preview),
  column-aware value/label dropdowns, unknown-column warnings, dataset
  preview table
- ✅ **Attachment manager** — the Form attachments dialog detects every file
  the form design references and lists what's **missing** with a one-click
  upload under the expected name; preview any CSV/GeoJSON or image
  attachment in place; rename a file and every reference
  (choices files, label media, annotate template defaults, implicit CSV
  lookups) follows in one undo step; per-row replace keeps the filename
  stable; same-name uploads stop at an explicit Replace / Keep both / Skip
  choice (with apply-to-all for batches) instead of silently overwriting
- ✅ **Label media & image annotation** — attach an image (plus zoomable
  big-image, audio or video) to any question, group or choice label right
  from the properties panel: upload or pick an existing attachment, shared
  across languages by default with per-language overrides in the
  translations grid (new languages inherit media automatically). Image
  questions take a template image in Default — the annotate widget's
  draw-on-top pattern — serialized as `jr://images/…` with pyxform parity;
  missing files surface in Problems and the attachments dialog
- ✅ **Entities** — dataset declaration, create/update/upsert flows
  (pyxform-parity), per-question `save_to` with reserved-name validation,
  follow-up form wizard
- ✅ **Form templates** — bilingual starter gallery (household survey,
  registration, site monitoring, feedback) + save any form as a local
  template. Curate the gallery: rename or delete your saved templates
  (deletion asks first), replace an existing one instead of duplicating it
  when you save under the same name, and hide starters you never use —
  restore them any time; insert any template's questions into the **open**
  form from the canvas toolbar's gear menu
- ✅ **Workspace backup** — export/import the whole library as a lossless
  `.formforge.zip` archive: forms + attachments, your saved form templates, your
  ODK Central server config + publish history, and your app preferences (theme,
  accent, interface language, layout); saved passwords are opt-in on export
  (warning shown). Before exporting, Settings shows what the backup will
  contain; re-importing the same backup never duplicates templates (identical
  ones are skipped and reported). Exporting a **single form** stays credential-free — safe to
  share
- ✅ **In-app help** — single help drawer with a searchable question-type
  reference and per-type detail (appearances, parameters, platform
  support), field-level "?" popovers — each type-specific parameter's "?"
  explains that parameter (description, allowed tokens, default, required,
  and the exact XLSForm `parameters` key) — plus nine step-by-step
  workflow guides (canvas multi-select, translations, logic, datasets,
  entities, backup, templates, autosave, keyboard) with contextual "?"
  entry points and dismissable first-use callouts; fully offline, linked
  to the official ODK docs
- ✅ **Iframe embed API** — origin-pinned postMessage protocol for host
  applications (load/save with attachments, export toggles, memory or
  local persistence); reference host at `/embed-demo.html`
- ✅ **Offline PWA** — installable, full app shell precached, hybrid
  self-update (automatic at load/idle, prompted mid-edit)
- ✅ **Internationalized UI** — English, **French** and **Spanish**,
  terminology-aligned with ODK Collect/Central's own translations;
  auto-detected from the browser language on first run, switchable in
  Settings, host-controllable when embedded; translation-ready foundations
  for more (typed message catalog, RTL-prepared layout)
- ✅ **Light/dark/system theme + accent presets** — a color-scheme
  preference (light, dark, or follow-OS) plus six accent colors (ODK blue,
  purple, green, teal, amber, rose) that restyle the builder chrome **and**
  the live preview together; a 3-state header toggle and a Settings
  "Appearance" section, persisted locally, no light-flash on reload,
  host-controllable when embedded
- ✅ **High-contrast mode (accessibility)** — an orthogonal contrast
  preference (normal, high, or follow-OS via `prefers-contrast`) crossing
  with the color scheme: WCAG-AAA surfaces with hard borders replacing
  tints and shadows, accent colors auto-clamped to 7:1 steps (enforced by
  a unit-tested ratio gate), applied to chrome and preview alike, plus
  forced-colors (Windows Contrast Themes) fixes
- ✅ **WCAG AA by default (accessibility)** — the *normal* mode is
  AA-conformant too: every accent's buttons/links/tabs auto-clamped to
  ≥4.5:1 per theme (generator + ratio gate, mirroring the AAA machinery),
  readable muted text and status colors, a valid ARIA tree for the canvas,
  labelled inputs throughout (properties panel, translations grid), and
  localized screen-reader strings for built-in controls (en/fr/es); a
  playwright+axe audit (`pnpm audit:a11y`) sweeps the real UI across
  theme × contrast × accent modes and gates CI at zero violations
- ✅ **Settings page** — gear on the library header routing to workspace
  export/import, UI-language selection, and an About panel (app version,
  storage-persistence status)
- ✅ **CI/CD** — lint/typecheck/test/e2e pipeline, release-please
  versioning, GitHub Pages deploys gated on e2e, weekly self-hosted
  Renovate dependency PRs tuned to the repo's version pins (needs a
  `RENOVATE_TOKEN` secret — see the renovate spec user-guide)
- ✅ **UX polish pass (design critique)** — trustworthy visual logic
  builder (notes excluded, sensible defaults, empty-comparison warnings),
  problems panel with per-question location chips and grouping, "Ready"
  state + export readiness summary, richer library cards, fully wrapping
  question labels with jump-free hover actions in the card footer,
  always-labeled Preview/Export; the four form tools (Form settings,
  Translations, Choice lists, Attachments) live in the canvas toolbar's
  gear menu, and every shortcut-triggering button states its shortcut in
  its tooltip — no anonymous overflow menus

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # start the dev server
pnpm test         # unit + component tests (vitest)
pnpm test:e2e     # end-to-end tests (playwright; run `pnpm exec playwright install` once)
pnpm lint         # eslint (neostandard)
pnpm typecheck    # vue-tsc
pnpm build        # production build (static files in dist/)
pnpm verify:webforms  # check ODK design-token/preset parity with @getodk/web-forms
```

Deploy `dist/` to any static host — hash routing needs no rewrite rules.
For project pages under a sub-path, build with `BASE_PATH=/repo-name/`.

### Releasing (GitHub Pages)

CI, release automation and Pages deploys are ready in `.github/workflows/`.

### Embedding

Host pages can embed the builder in an iframe (`?embed=1`) and drive it
over a postMessage API (load/save with attachments, export toggles):
see [`docs/specs/2026-07-09-2235-embed-postmessage-api/user-guide.md`](docs/specs/2026-07-09-2235-embed-postmessage-api/user-guide.md)
and the live reference host at `/embed-demo.html`.

### Connecting to ODK Central (CORS)

ODK Central's API does **not** send permissive CORS headers by default, so a
browser blocks the builder's cross-origin requests until CORS is enabled. This
can only be relaxed **server-side** — there is no pure-client bypass (a public
CORS proxy would route your credentials through third-party infrastructure, so
it's deliberately unsupported). You have two shapes:

- **You control the server** — add the CORS headers at Central's fronting nginx
  (or any reverse proxy / load balancer), or serve the builder same-origin
  behind Central. Copy-paste recipes are in the
  [integration user guide](docs/specs/2026-07-13-1331-central-publishing/user-guide.md#self-hoster-setup-making-central-reachable-from-the-builder-cors).
- **You don't** — run a small local proxy on your own machine. The repo ships
  a script (bash for macOS/Linux, PowerShell for Windows) that downloads a
  stock [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) binary into `.local/` (gitignored) and
  generates/updates a `Caddyfile` forwarding to your Central server with the
  headers added. Point it at your server and register the proxied URL in the
  builder:

  ```bash
  # macOS / Linux — scripts/central-cors-proxy.sh
  scripts/central-cors-proxy.sh -u https://central.example.org -n my-central
  .local/caddy run --config .local/Caddyfile
  # then register  http://localhost:8123/my-central  as the server URL
  ```

  ```powershell
  # Windows — scripts\central-cors-proxy.ps1
  .\scripts\central-cors-proxy.ps1 -Upstream https://central.example.org -Prefix my-central
  .\.local\caddy.exe run --config .\.local\Caddyfile
  # then register  http://localhost:8123/my-central  as the server URL
  ```

  Re-run it once per server (`-n`/`-Prefix` + `-u`/`-Upstream`) to build up a
  multi-server proxy; both scripts read the same `CENTRAL_PROXY_*` env-var
  defaults and produce an identical Caddyfile. Minimum supported Central:
  **2024.3**.

### Architecture

- `src/core/` — pure TypeScript engines (no Vue/Pinia/Dexie): form model,
  `${field}` ↔ XPath expression rewriting, structured condition grammar,
  XForm serializer/parser, XLSForm reader/writer, dataset parsing,
  workspace archives, validators. Everything here is unit-tested in Node.
- `src/stores/` — Pinia stores (form document + undo/redo + autosave,
  workspace library, preview orchestration, embed config, Central connection
  state; session tokens and the vault key are held in module closures, never
  in reactive/devtools-visible state).
- `src/persistence/` — storage behind a backend seam: Dexie/IndexedDB by
  default (forms, binary attachments, snapshots, templates, plus device-local
  Central servers, encrypted vault meta and publish targets), in-memory for
  embed mode.
- `src/components/`, `src/views/` — the builder UI, styled with the design
  tokens `@getodk/web-forms` injects so builder and preview feel like one
  product (guarded by `tests/unit/theme-parity.spec.ts`).
- `src/embed/`, `src/pwa/`, `src/help/`, `src/i18n/`, `src/templates/` —
  the embed bridge/protocol, service-worker update policy, help content,
  message catalogs, bundled starter templates.
- `tests/golden/` — XLSForm fixtures + pinned pyxform output; regenerate
  deliberately with `uv run --with openpyxl --with pyxform scripts/make-goldens.py`.

Product docs live in [`docs/product/`](docs/product/mission.md); each work
package has a spec folder under [`docs/specs/`](docs/specs/) and a browser
verification log under [`docs/verification/`](docs/verification/).
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) is the repository index for AI-assisted work.
